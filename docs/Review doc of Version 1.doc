NOTE: I uploaded a 10 minute screen recording of my project and the progress so far. But below is my overall review.

Current Progress
I think my project is in a good space and practically workable, however, I did run into a few snags with 
•	metric conversion due to non traditional measurements listed in the API drink instructions such as “ a dash of salt” or a “lemon peel”.
•	Thumbnail image sizes (all resolved)

Some issues that I am still running into:
•	Empty drink category pages such as “Other Unknown” and “Coffee/Tea”. 
•	When I search coffee or tea, I get results, however, I don’t get results when I select the category button. I am trying to figure out why it is not pulling for that category.
•	How many features are too many features? 

Ideas for next steps and new features:
•	For any empty pages, the user will have the option to create a recipe. 
•	Maybe create a feature to find the nearest liquor store with the ingredients needed
 
Questions:
1.	What are you expecting for the final version?
2.	How many more features should I add?
3.	Are my milestones going too far?

Milestones
  
Milestone 1: Implement a "Create Your Own Recipe" Option for Empty Pages
•	Purpose: Add functionality that allows users to create their own recipes on any empty pages where no recipes are found.
•	Tasks:
o	Design a form for users to input recipe details such as name, ingredients, measurements, instructions, and an image.
o	Add a "Create Recipe" button on empty pages.
o	Store the user-created recipes in the database and display them on the "Saved Recipes" page.

  Milestone 2: Integrate a Map API to Find Nearest Liquor Stores
•	Purpose: Provide users with a feature to find the nearest liquor store that stocks the ingredients needed for a selected recipe.
•	Tasks:
o	Research and choose a suitable map API (e.g., Google Maps, MapQuest).
o	Create a feature that extracts ingredients from a recipe and searches for nearby stores that stock these ingredients.
o	Add a "Find Nearest Liquor Store" button on recipe pages.

  Milestone 3: Improve User Experience on "Not Found" Pages
•	Purpose: Enhance the user experience by offering options when a recipe, category, drink, or page cannot be found.
•	Tasks:
o	Create a user-friendly "Not Found" page with options to create a new recipe or go back to the home page.
o	Include helpful links or suggestions for similar categories or recipes.
o	Implement a fallback route in the Flask application for handling 404 errors.

  Milestone 4: Refine the Search and Filter Functionality
•	Purpose: Ensure the search and filter functionalities are working seamlessly, including the "Alcoholic" and "Non-Alcoholic" filters. Add more useful filters.
•	Tasks:
o	Debug and fix any existing issues with the search and filter functionalities.
o	Ensure that filtered search results correctly display the drinks based on user input.
o	Test the advanced search filter with different combinations of search criteria to ensure accuracy.
